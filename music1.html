			<h2>Something about the song:</h2>
			<p>"I Loves You, Porgy" is a duet from the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin. The duet occurs in act 2, scene 3, Catfish Row, where Porgy promises Bess that he will protect her. Bess has a lover, Crown, who is abusive and continually seduces her. Simone's version of “I Loves You, Porgy” became a Top 20 hit in 1959 from her first album, Little Girl Blue. After this song, she decided to move to New York to capitalize on her success.</p>
