            <h3>About Nina Simone</h3>
            <p>Nina Simone, born Eunice Kathleen Waymon, was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, and civil rights activist. She was a child prodigy, and a fund had been set up by people in her native Tryon, North Carolina to help her become the first female black concert pianist in the US.</p>
            <p>She enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission in 1951. This rejection was a turning point in her career, which she later came to understand was racially motivated.</p>
            <p>After various legitimate jobs, Eunice adopted a stage name to ensure her Methodist minister mother wouldn't find out she was playing music in an Atlantic City bar - Nina was a pet name given to her by a boyfriend; Simone came from French actress Simone Signoret.</p>
            <p>She quickly built up a repertoire of interspersing gospel songs with Bach, Czerny and Liszt and a steady following, leading to interest from Bethlehem Records, which released her debut album, Little Girl Blue, in 1958.</p>
