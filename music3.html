			<h2>Something about the song:</h2>
			<p>In the early 1960s, Simone often performed in New York City's Greenwich Village, where she mixed with artists and intellectuals like James Baldwin and Langston Hughes. Simone took part in a 1961 American Society of African Culture conference in Lagos, Nigeria. These experiences prompted Simone to get involved with the Civil Rights Movement in the early 60s. She released the iconic protest song “Mississippi Goddam” in 1964, in reaction to the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama and the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, both in 1963. The song expressed her frustration with the slow pace of change in response to the efforts of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
